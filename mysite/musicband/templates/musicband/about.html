      <p>After more than 25 years in music, building an unimpeachable reputation as a truly independent artist and entrepreneur, Julian Taylor now owns his legacy.
          From the formative rock of Staggered Crossing to the genre fusion of Julian Taylor Band, and now his revered work as a solo singer-songwriter, Julian owns the rights to it all, and it couldn’t have happened at a better time.</p>
      <p>It’s rare in this era to see an artist build slowly and reach a new level of widespread acclaim two decades into their career.
          But Julian’s ethos, work ethic, and artistry have always had a timeless quality to them.</p>
